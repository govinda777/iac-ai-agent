## üìä Overview

The **IaC AI Agent** is an intelligent bot that analyzes Terraform code and provides:

- **‚úÖ Security Analysis**: Integrates with Checkov to detect vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
- **‚úÖ LLM-Powered Insights**: Delivers contextual suggestions using GPT-4 and other large language models.
- **‚úÖ Drift Detection**: Identifies discrepancies between your code and deployed infrastructure.
- **‚úÖ Cost Optimization**: Recommends cost-saving opportunities with detailed estimates.
- **‚úÖ Best Practices**: Enforces architectural patterns and industry-standard best practices.
- **‚úÖ IAM Analysis**: Specializes in analyzing IAM policies for overly permissive or insecure configurations.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the IaC AI Agent locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Go**: Version 1.21 or higher
- **Docker**: For running the application in a containerized environment
- **Node.js**: For managing smart contract dependencies
- **Privy.io Account**: For Web3-native authentication
- **OpenAI API Key**: For leveraging LLM-powered analysis

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/govinda777/iac-ai-agent
cd iac-ai-agent
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and add your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

You will need to add the following required variables to your `.env` file:

- `PRIVY_APP_ID` and `PRIVY_APP_SECRET`: Get these from your [Privy.io dashboard](https://privy.io/).
- `LLM_API_KEY`: Your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
- `BASE_RPC_URL`: The RPC URL for the Base network (e.g., `https://goerli.base.org` for testnet).

### 3. Run the Application

You can run the agent using either Go or Docker.

**Using Go:**

```bash
# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Run the application
go run cmd/agent/main.go
```

**Using Docker:**

```bash
# Build and run the Docker container
docker-compose up
```

### 4. Run Tests

The project uses `godog` for BDD testing. To run the tests:

```bash
# Install Godog
go install github.com/cucumber/godog/cmd/godog@latest

# Run all tests
godog test/bdd/features/
```

## ‚ú® Features

The IaC AI Agent offers a robust set of features designed to improve the quality, security, and cost-effectiveness of your infrastructure.

- **Intelligent Agent System**: The agent is built with a modular and extensible architecture, allowing for different analysis "personalities" (e.g., Security Specialist, Cost Optimizer).
- **Web3-Native Integration**: Authentication is handled via [Privy.io](https://privy.io), allowing users to log in with their wallet or email. The system also supports on-chain payments and access control using NFTs on the Base network.
- **Comprehensive Security Analysis**: In addition to Checkov, the agent includes specialized analyzers for IAM policies, helping to identify and fix potential security risks.
- **Cost Optimization**: The agent provides actionable recommendations for reducing cloud costs, complete with estimated savings.
- **Drift Detection**: Keep your infrastructure in sync with your code by automatically detecting and reporting any drift.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The IaC AI Agent is built with a clean, layered architecture that separates concerns and promotes extensibility.

    end

```

- **Backend (Go)**: The core of the application is a Go backend that exposes a REST API for handling analysis requests. It includes a suite of analyzers, an LLM client for intelligent suggestions, and a knowledge base of best practices.
- **Web3 Integration**: The agent integrates with the Base network for on-chain operations, including NFT-based access control and token payments.
- **Frontend**: A Next.js frontend provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the agent, featuring seamless authentication via Privy.io.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

The following features are planned for future releases:

- **Preview Analysis**: Analyze `terraform plan` outputs to catch issues before they are applied.
- **Expanded IaC Support**: Add support for other IaC tools like CloudFormation and Pulumi.
- **Web Dashboard**: A comprehensive web interface for visualizing analysis results and managing agent settings.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Native integrations with popular CI/CD platforms like GitHub Actions, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
